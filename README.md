# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Objectives

The objectives of this project is to make an insightful data visualization by building a website that presents information about earthquake around the world. The project requires us to build interactive features in the website that can be used on desktop as well as mobile phones. We gathered the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survey website. We used _JavaScript_, _D3_ and _Leaflet_ libraries to retrieve the data and plotted data on _mapbox map_ through an API request. We showed the location of the earthquake by a circle marker whose diameter is proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake. A popup shows the magnitude and the location of the earthquake when the circle is clicked. An earthquake of larger magnitude is shown with a larger and darker color (red) circle, while a low magnitude earthquake is smaller and in lighter color (yellow). We added a legend in the lower right side that shows the color key of earthquake magnitude. The map contained the tectonic plate boundaries (faultlines) and the view can be toggled between a streetview, a satellite view as well as a dark view.
